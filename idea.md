Profile Section: Professional headshot on the left, bio on the right.

Timeline/CV: A stylized timeline of education and roles.

Skills Grid: Icons/Tags for technical skills.

Content & Copy
Bio Narrative: "I am Dr. Jamie Wubben. I operate at the intersection of deep tech and strategic management.

With a PhD in Informatics (Cum Laude), I spent years solving the hardest problems in robotics: how to make swarms of drones coordinate autonomously in unpredictable environments. Today, I apply that same rigor to business automation.


Whether I am writing algorithms for aerial missions or designing an AI workflow for a local business, my focus is the same: Efficiency, Resilience, and Intelligence."

Key Competencies:


Technical: UAV Programming, Swarm Intelligence, Artificial Intelligence, Embedded Systems.




Strategic: Strategic Management, Operational Efficiency, Cross-Cultural Collaboration.


Languages: English, Dutch, Spanish (Fluent).

6. Page: Contact
Goal: Conversion (Booking a call).

Wireframe / Layout
Simple Form: Name, Email, "I am interested in..." (Dropdown: Automation / UAVs).

Direct Info: Email address and LinkedIn button.

Calendar Embed: "Calendly" style widget for 15-min discovery calls.

Content & Copy
Headline: Let's Optimize.

Sub-text: "Based in Europe, working globally. I am available for freelance consulting, technical writing, and automation projects."

Note: "I speak English, Dutch, and Spanish."

7. Developer Notes (Technical Requirements)
Multilingual Support: The architecture must support easy toggling between EN/NL/ES.

Speed: The "Services" page must load instantly; avoid heavy video backgrounds on mobile.

SEO Strategy:

Keywords Page A: "UAV Swarm Consultant," "Drone Algorithm Engineer," "R&D Proposal Writer."

Keywords Page B: "Small Business AI Automation," "GenAI Consultant," "Workflow Optimization."

CMS: Use a lightweight CMS (like WordPress, Webflow, or Framer) so I can easily update my "Projects" list as I complete new freelance work.
