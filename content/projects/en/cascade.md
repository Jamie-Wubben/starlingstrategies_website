## Challenge

The challenge was to secure highly competitive Horizon Europe/Chips JU funding for a multi-partner Innovation Action. This required translating a complex vision—moving autonomous systems to a secure, collaborative System of Systems (SoS) that ensures European data sovereignty—into a compelling, technically and financially coherent proposal.

## Solution

As a Tender Specialist, my contribution was central to the proposal's structure and core narrative. I brought up critical ideas and wrote key sections, conceptualizing the framework for **Collaborative Autonomous Systems** and detailing the multi-stage, AI-enabled SoS architecture. I ensured the technical vision, including the focus on 100% data sovereignty and distributed intelligence, was clearly articulated to meet the strategic goals of the European funding call.

## Outcome

The outcome is the successful approval of the CASCADE project, securing a major 36-month R&D grant from the Chips Joint Undertaking. This positions the consortium to drive the next generation of intelligent, collaborative autonomous systems, strengthening Europe’s technological sovereignty in AI-enabled Cyber-Physical Systems.
