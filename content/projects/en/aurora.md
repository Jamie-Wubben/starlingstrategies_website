## Challenge

The challenge was to secure European Defence Fund (EDF) financing for a Research Action targeting disruptive technologies. This required developing a compelling, technically sound, and strategically aligned proposal for an autonomous UxV system. The focus was on overcoming critical operational issues like long-range coordination and mission orchestration in complex terrains.

## Solution

As a Tender Specialist, my contribution involved conceptualizing the system-of-systems solution, specifically focusing on the novel application of **UAV swarms** and their coordination. The resulting proposal outlines a disruptive approach combining AI-powered swarm autonomy, nanosatellite-based communications, and ethical human-machine teaming. I was responsible for UAV-swarm ideas and assistance in writing the proposal.

## Outcome

The outcome is the successful submission of the AURORA proposal, which details a modular and scalable architecture designed to advance Europe's strategic autonomy in critical dual-use technologies. The project, if approved, runs for 36 months and has requested a total grant amount of 4 million euros. The proposal is now under evaluation.
