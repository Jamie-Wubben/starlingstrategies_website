## Challenge

Automating responses to common client inquiries (opening hours, services, directions) on WhatsApp to provide 24/7 instant support, reduce staff workload, and maintain a high standard of conversational quality.

## Solution

Developed a secure WhatsApp chatbot leveraging a Large Language Model (LLM) fine-tuned on the client's specific business knowledge base. The solution integrated the WhatsApp Business API with a custom backend for context-aware, human-like, and accurate automated replies.

## Outcome

Achieved a significant reduction in routine customer service tickets, enabling instant query resolution and providing a scalable, consistent 24/7 customer experience, leading to higher client satisfaction and operational efficiency.
