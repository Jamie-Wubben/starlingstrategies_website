## Challenge
Developing a computationally efficient and scalable real-time collision avoidance scheme for a swarm of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) operating in complex, obstacle-rich shared airspace.

## Solution
Designed and implemented a Distributed Force Field Protocol. This system utilizes calculated attraction and repulsion forces between agents and obstacles to dynamically generate collision-free trajectories and ensure safe swarm navigation.

## Outcome
A highly scalable and robust control system, enabling safe, real-time cooperative navigation and collision-free coordination for multi-agent UAV systems using a reactive force-based approach.
