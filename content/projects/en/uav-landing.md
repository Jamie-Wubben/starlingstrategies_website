## Challenge
The inherent inaccuracies of GPS-based systems (errors up to a few meters) make precise autonomous landing of UAVs unreliable, especially in confined or indoor environments where GPS is unavailable.

## Solution
Developed a robust, vision-based landing strategy using multi-size ArUco markers for accurate ground pattern recognition. This system enabled the UAV to detect the target from altitudes up to 30m and continuously adjust its descent trajectory for maximum precision.

## Outcome
Validated the system with a real UAV, achieving highly accurate landings with a minimal mean error of just **0.11m**, significantly outperforming standard GPS methods and enabling complex swarm or automated delivery applications.
