## Challenge
To create a low-power, real-time health and behavior monitoring system for dogs by classifying their vocalizations and sounds into 11 distinct classes (e.g., barking, eating, vomiting). The solution needed to be deployed on a resource-constrained microcontroller.

## Solution
Developed a highly optimized, quantized TinyML model using TensorFlow to perform acoustic classification. The model was trained to distinguish 11 distinct dog sounds and deployed directly onto a low-cost microcontroller for real-time, on-device inference.

## Outcome
A portable, non-invasive device capable of providing owners and veterinarians with instantaneous, actionable data on a dog's health and emotional state, ensuring timely intervention for potential issues.
